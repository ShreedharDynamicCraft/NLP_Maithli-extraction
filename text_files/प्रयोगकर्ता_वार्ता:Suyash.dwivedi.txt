Hello
Suyash.dwivedi
,
I hope this message finds you well.
I am contacting you because I posted
a message
from the WMF Language team in your Wikipedia village pump to communicate our proposal to make the
MinT
with the
IndicTrans2
model the default machine translation in Maithili Wikipedia.
We would appreciate your reading the message and giving us feedback on our proposal in the thread. You can also ask some of Maithili Wikipedia community members to read the message and let us know if they are okay with having MinT as the default translation in your Wikipedia.
Thank you so much for your feedback and help.
Best regards,
UOzurumba (WMF)
