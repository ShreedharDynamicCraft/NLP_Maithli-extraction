Need my help?


If the matter is important or I do not give a response within a reasonable period of time (about 2 - 3 days at most) or there's a backlog on {Wikibooks or MediaWiki} that requires something that you cannot do, it's OK to ask on my talk page - I respond to them quickly since I get notified by email.


If the matter is less urgent, pinging is OK. In practice, I respond to pings quickly as well, but do message me on my talk page if I miss one by chance.


Special:EmailUser
 is also fine. Discord is also OK but is not recommended.


The same applies to anything on the 
Beta Cluster
 since I have full rights there.


I have two hands. The left hand writes code, and the right hand proves things, and I can't let go of either. That's why I do both in real life. Oh, and I have a 
GitHub page
.

But on Wikimedia, my hands work for me as a Wikibooks, MediaWiki and Meta-Wiki administrator (if I'm active, that is).
