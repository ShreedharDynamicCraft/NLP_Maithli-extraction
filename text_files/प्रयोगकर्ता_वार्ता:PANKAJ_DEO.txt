Hi WAM Organizer! Hopefully, everything works just fine so far! 
Need Help Button
, post in any language is fine




Here are some recent updates and clarification of rules for you, and as always, let me know if you have any idea, thought or question.

Additional souvenirs (e.g. postcard) will be sent to Ambassadors and active organizers.


A participant's article count is combined on all language Wikipedias they have contributed to


Only Wikipedia Asian Month on Wikipedia or Wikivoyage projects count (no WikiQuote, etc.)


The global top 3 article count will only be eligible on Wikipedias where the WAM article requirement is at least 3,000 bytes and 300 words.


If your community accepts an extension for articles, you should set up a page and allow participants to submit their contributions there.


In case of redirection not allowed submitting in Fountain tool, a workaround is to delete it, copy and submit again. Or a submission page can be used too.


Please make sure enforce the rules, such as proper references, notability, and length.


International organizers will double check the top 3 users' accepted articles, so if your articles are not fulfilling the rules, they might be disqualified. We don't want it happened so please don't let us make such a decision.


Please feel free to contact me and WAM team on 
meta talk page
, send me an email by Email this User or chat with me on facebook. For some languages, the activity for WAM is very less, If you need any help please reach out to us, still, 12 more days left for WAM, Please encourage your community members to take part in it.

Wiki Loves Love
 (WLL) is an International photography competition of Wikimedia Commons to subject love testimonials happening in the month of February 2019.

The primary goal of the competition is to document love testimonials through human cultural diversity such as monuments, ceremonies, snapshot of tender gesture, and miscellaneous objects used as symbol of love; to illustrate articles in the worldwide free encyclopedia Wikipedia, and other Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) projects. February is around the corner and Wiki Loves Love team invites you to organize and promote WLL19 in your country and join hands with us to celebrate love and document it on Wikimedia Commons. The theme of 2019 is 
Festivals, ceremonies and celebrations of love
.

To organize Wiki Loves Love in your region, sign up at WLL 
Organizers
 page. You can also simply support and spread love by helping us 
translate
 the commons page in your local language which is open for translation.

The contest starts runs from 1-28 February 2019. Independent from if there is a local contest organised in your country, you can help by making the photo contest Wiki Loves Love more accessible and available to more people in the world by translating the upload wizard, templates and pages to your local language. See for an overview
of templates/pages to be translated at our 
Translations page
.

Imagine...The sum of all love!

How we will see unregistered users
[
सम्पादन करी
]




Hi!

You get this message because you are an admin on a Wikimedia wiki.

When someone edits a Wikimedia wiki without being logged in today, we show their IP address. As you may already know, we will not be able to do this in the future. This is a decision by the Wikimedia Foundation Legal department, because norms and regulations for privacy online have changed.

Instead of the IP we will show a masked identity. You as an admin 
will still be able to access the IP
. There will also be a new user right for those who need to see the full IPs of unregistered users to fight vandalism, harassment and spam without being admins. Patrollers will also see part of the IP even without this user right. We are also working on 
better tools
 to help.

If you have not seen it before, you can 
read more on Meta
. If you want to make sure you don’t miss technical changes on the Wikimedia wikis, you can 
subscribe
 to 
the weekly technical newsletter
.

We have 
two suggested ways
 this identity could work. 
We would appreciate your feedback
 on which way you think would work best for you and your wiki, now and in the future. You can 
let us know on the talk page
. You can write in your language. The suggestions were posted in October and we will decide after 17 January.

Thank you.

Throughout this event, our focus remains centered on three primary areas: Wikipedia, Wikidata, and Wikimedia Commons.
