WAM Organizers Update (Nov.5)
[
सम्पादन करी

Hi WAM Organizer! Hopefully everything works just fine so far! 
Need Help Button
, post in any language is fine




Here are some recent updates for you, and as always, let me know if you have any idea, thought or question.

IMPORTANT: Asian Language Wikipedia will exclude the language speaking country from the Asian Month so we can encourage editors write something about other part of Asia. E.g., Chinese Wikipedia will exclude Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Indian language Wikipedia will exclude India. If you have problems with that, please let me know.


I've posted the tool instruction and newest postcard rules on each Wiki' event page. Make sure you translate it. In short: 4 articles get one card, 15 get another one (Special one), and the Ambassador gets another one.


We will still allow two Ambassadors if top and second contributors have more than 30 accepted articles, just like last year. Please send this information to high-quantity participant to encourage them.


Please create 
this talk page template
 and linked in Wikidata. Judging tool will add this template to submitted articles automatically.


The judging tool should work fine. If not, talk to me.


You may put this template on your user page if you like it. 
en:Template:User WAM organizer


Optional: Judging Tool Interface may not available in your language. If you feel needed, you can 
translate the interface at here
.


Invite some active contributors from your wiki to participate. And please encourage editors who can speak more than one language participate to other WAM edition.


Indic Community: 
CIS-A2K
 will provide fund if you would like to organize an offline event of Wikipedia Asian Month. 
Apply at here
.


Best Wishes,

WAM Organizers Update (Nov.12)
[

Hi WAM Organizer! Hopefully everything works just fine so far! 
Need Help Button
, post in any language is fine




Here are some recent updates for you, and as always, let me know if you have any idea, thought or question.

Additional souvenirs (e.g. Stickers, bookmarks) will sent to Ambassadors and active organizers.


I'm doing some basic statistics at 
Result page
 every week, in case you are interested.


I've already sent noticfication to global top 20 users that WMF will give global top 3 contributors a free Wikimedia T-shirt. Here are the rules:

A participant's article count is combined on all language Wikipedias they have contributed to


Only Wikipedia Asian Month on Wikipedia projects will count (no WikiQuote, etc.)


The global top 3 article count will only be eligible on Wikipedias where the WAM article requirement is at least 3,000 Bytes and 300 words.


Please make sure enforce the rules, such as proper references, notability, and length.


International organizers will double check the top 3 users' accepted articles, so if your articles are not fulfilling the rules, you might be disqualified. We don't want it happened so please don't let us make such a decision.


Rest of Global top 10 users will also get some WAM souvenirs.


Best Wishes, 

Addis Wang

Hi WAM organizers! It's now half way! Good job! Here are some updates:



As many of you may notice, that the judging tool has came back to normal.


I've set up a result page with some numbers in it. It may not accurate, just as a reference at this time.


WAM should get more media coverage. If you can help (either locally or internationally), please let me know!


Please considering start judging articles if you have not yet. it's really important to give feedbacks to participants so they can improve articles or get motivated.


With your help, I may start the first round of address collection before WAM ends for who already have four accepted articles and organizers, as I promised to improve the postcard sending process this year.

Tool problem


If you can not submit articles via judging tool, use 
this meta page

Here are what will come after the end of WAM


Make sure you judge all articles before December 5th, and participants who can improve their contribution (not submit) before December 10th.


Participates still can submit their contribution in November before December 2nd at 
this page
. Please let your local wiki participates know. Once you finish the judging, please update 
this page
 after December 5th


There will be three round of address collection scheduled: December 2nd, December 7th, and December 20th.


Please report the local Wikipedia Asian Ambassador (who has most accepted articles) 
on this page
, if the 2nd participants has more than 30 accepted articles, you will have two ambassadors.


I will announce the name of Wikipedians who will able to pick a Wikimedia T-shirt from Wikimedia Store for free after I re-check their contributions.


There will be a progress page for the postcards.


Some Questions


It could be a case that local organizer does not agree on an article if shall accept it or not. In this situation, the judging tool will highlight the conflict articles in the "article's list". Please review other's opinion, and resolve the conflict by changing your decision or discuss with other judges.

Review of initial updates on Wikimedia movement strategy process
[
सम्पादन करी

Note: Apologies for cross-posting and sending in English. 
Message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki
.


The Wikimedia movement is beginning a movement-wide strategy discussion, a process which will run throughout 2017. For 15 years, Wikimedians have worked together to build the largest free knowledge resource in human history. During this time, we've grown from a small group of editors to a diverse network of editors, developers, affiliates, readers, donors, and partners. Today, we are more than a group of websites. We are a movement rooted in values and a powerful vision: all knowledge for all people. As a movement, we have an opportunity to decide where we go from here. 

This movement strategy discussion will focus on the future of our movement: where we want to go together, and what we want to achieve. We hope to design an inclusive process that makes space for everyone: editors, community leaders, affiliates, developers, readers, donors, technology platforms, institutional partners, and people we have yet to reach. There will be multiple ways to participate including on-wiki, in private spaces, and in-person meetings. You are warmly invited to join and make your voice heard.

The immediate goal is to have a strategic direction by Wikimania 2017 to help frame a discussion on how we work together toward that strategic direction.

Regular updates are being sent to the 
Wikimedia-l mailing list
, and posted 
on Meta-Wiki
. Beginning with this message, monthly reviews of these updates will be sent to this page as well. 
Sign up
 to receive future announcements and monthly highlights of strategy updates on your user talk page.

This message, "
We invite you to join the movement strategy conversation (now through April 15)
", was sent through multiple channels by  
Gregory Varnum
 on 15 and 16 of March 2017 to village pumps, affiliate talk pages, movement mailing lists, and MassMessage groups. A similar message was sent by 
Nicole Ebber
 to organized groups and their mailing lists on 15 of March 2017. This version of the message is available for translation and documentation purposes


Dear Wikimedians/Wikipedians:

Today we are starting a broad discussion to define Wikimedia's future role in the world and develop a collaborative strategy to fulfill that role. You are warmly invited to join the conversation.

There are many ways to participate, by joining an existing conversation or starting your own: 

Track A (organized groups)
: Discussions with your affiliate, committee or other organized group (these are groups that support the Wikimedia movement). 

Track B (individual contributors): 
On Meta
 or your 
local language or project wiki
.

This is the first of three conversations, and it will run between now and April 15. The purpose of cycle 1 is to discuss the future of the movement and generate major themes around potential directions. What do we want to build or achieve together over the next 15 years?

We welcome you, as we create this conversation together, and look forward to broad and diverse participation from all parts of our movement.

Sincerely,


Nicole Ebber (Track A Lead), Jaime Anstee (Track B Lead), & the

[
सम्पादन करी
]




Message is available for translation on Meta-Wiki




The Wikimedia movement strategy core team and working groups have completed reviewing the more than 1800 thematic statements we received from the first discussion. They have identified 
5 themes that were consistent across all the conversations
 - each with their own set of sub-themes. These are not the final themes, just an initial working draft of the core concepts.

You are invited to 
join the online and offline discussions taking place
 on these 5 themes. This round of discussions will take place between now and June 12th. You can discuss as many as you like; we ask you to participate in the ones that are most (or least) important to you.

Here are the five themes, each has a page on Meta-Wiki with more information about the theme and how to participate in that theme's discussion:



Healthy, Inclusive Communities


The Augmented Age


A Truly Global Movement


The Most Respected Source of Knowledge


Engaging in the Knowledge Ecosystem


On the 
movement strategy portal on Meta-Wiki
, you can find more information about each of these themes, their discussions, and how to participate.

WAM Organizers Update
[
सम्पादन करी
]


Hi WAM Organizer! Hopefully, everything works just fine so far! 
Need Help Button
, post in any language is fine




Here are some recent updates and clarification of rules for you, and as always, let me know if you have any idea, thought or question.

Additional souvenirs (e.g. postcard) will be sent to Ambassadors and active organizers.


A participant's article count is combined on all language Wikipedias they have contributed to


Only Wikipedia Asian Month on Wikipedia or Wikivoyage projects count (no WikiQuote, etc.)


The global top 3 article count will only be eligible on Wikipedias where the WAM article requirement is at least 3,000 bytes and 300 words.


If your community accepts an extension for articles, you should set up a page and allow participants to submit their contributions there.


In case of redirection not allowed submitting in Fountain tool, a workaround is to delete it, copy and submit again. Or a submission page can be used too.


Please make sure enforce the rules, such as proper references, notability, and length.


International organizers will double check the top 3 users' accepted articles, so if your articles are not fulfilling the rules, they might be disqualified. We don't want it happened so please don't let us make such a decision.


Please feel free to contact me and WAM team on 
meta talk page
, send me an email by Email this User or chat with me on facebook. For some languages, the activity for WAM is very less, If you need any help please reach out to us, still, 12 more days left for WAM, Please encourage your community members to take part in it.

If you no longer want to receive the WAM organizer message, you can remove your username at 
this page

Best Wishes,

]






Wiki Loves Love
 (WLL) is an International photography competition of Wikimedia Commons to subject love testimonials happening in the month of February 2019.

The primary goal of the competition is to document love testimonials through human cultural diversity such as monuments, ceremonies, snapshot of tender gesture, and miscellaneous objects used as symbol of love; to illustrate articles in the worldwide free encyclopedia Wikipedia, and other Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) projects. February is around the corner and Wiki Loves Love team invites you to organize and promote WLL19 in your country and join hands with us to celebrate love and document it on Wikimedia Commons. The theme of 2019 is 
Festivals, ceremonies and celebrations of love
.

To organize Wiki Loves Love in your region, sign up at WLL 
Organizers
 page. You can also simply support and spread love by helping us 
translate
 the commons page in your local language which is open for translation.

The contest starts runs from 1-28 February 2019. Independent from if there is a local contest organised in your country, you can help by making the photo contest Wiki Loves Love more accessible and available to more people in the world by translating the upload wizard, templates and pages to your local language. See for an overview
of templates/pages to be translated at our 
Translations page
.

Imagine...The sum of all love!

Wiki Loves Love team

How we will see unregistered users
[
सम्पादन करी
]




Hi!

You get this message because you are an admin on a Wikimedia wiki.

When someone edits a Wikimedia wiki without being logged in today, we show their IP address. As you may already know, we will not be able to do this in the future. This is a decision by the Wikimedia Foundation Legal department, because norms and regulations for privacy online have changed.

Instead of the IP we will show a masked identity. You as an admin 
will still be able to access the IP
. There will also be a new user right for those who need to see the full IPs of unregistered users to fight vandalism, harassment and spam without being admins. Patrollers will also see part of the IP even without this user right. We are also working on 
better tools
 to help.

If you have not seen it before, you can 
read more on Meta
. If you want to make sure you don’t miss technical changes on the Wikimedia wikis, you can 
subscribe
 to 
the weekly technical newsletter
.

We have 
two suggested ways
 this identity could work. 
We would appreciate your feedback
 on which way you think would work best for you and your wiki, now and in the future. You can 
let us know on the talk page
. You can write in your language. The suggestions were posted in October and we will decide after 17 January.

Thank you. 
/
Johan (WMF)

Your advanced permissions on maiwiki
[
सम्पादन करी
]


Hello. A 
policy
 regarding the removal of "advanced rights" (administrator, bureaucrat, interface administrator, etc.) was adopted by 
community consensus
 in 2013. According to this policy, the stewards are reviewing activity on wikis with no inactivity policy.

You meet the inactivity criteria (no edits and no logged actions for 2 years) on this wiki. Since this wiki, to the best of our knowledge, does not have its own rights review process, the global one applies.

If you want to keep your advanced permissions, you should inform the community of the wiki about the fact that the stewards have sent you this information about your inactivity. A community notice about this process has been also posted on the local Village Pump of this wiki. If the community has a discussion about it and then wants you to keep your rights, please contact the stewards at the 
m:Stewards' noticeboard
, and link to the discussion of the local community, where they express their wish to continue to maintain the rights.

If you wish to resign your rights, please 
request removal of your rights on Meta
.

If there is no response at all after one month, stewards will proceed to remove your administrator and/or bureaucrat rights. In ambiguous cases, stewards will evaluate the responses and will refer a decision back to the local community for their comment and review. If you have any questions, please contact the 
stewards
.

Yours faithfully.
