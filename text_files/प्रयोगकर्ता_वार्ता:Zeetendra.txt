Hi WAM organizers!
Thanks again for organizing Wikipedia Asian Month. There are only 7 days before it starts. Here are some notices and guidelines for organizing.

Article Requirement is 4
Article criteria is 3k bytes and 300 words. NO 2k bytes for smaller Wikipedia.
According to the tool's limit, IP users can not participate. Please encourage them register an account.
Please localize
this template
and used on sign up page. I will update the template once the tool is ready to be used.
You can also localize this template and use as an invitation letter.

You may localize this Q&A page, but you can also just put a link towards the meta page.
m:Wikipedia Asian Month/QA
You may want to invite some of your Wikipedia friends or active Wikipedians from your home WIKI to help you organize.
You may want to send some invitation to last year participants, active Wikipedians, and Wikipedians who has a special interest.

We will keep sending postcards (new design) this year, and as an organizer you will receive an additional postcard as well.
We will send the Ambassador a regular paper copy of the certificate through the basic mail.

Hi WAM Organizer! Hopefully everything works just fine so far!
Need Help Button
, post in any language is fine
Here are some recent updates for you, and as always, let me know if you have any idea, thought or question.
IMPORTANT: Asian Language Wikipedia will exclude the language speaking country from the Asian Month so we can encourage editors write something about other part of Asia. E.g., Chinese Wikipedia will exclude Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. Indian language Wikipedia will exclude India. If you have problems with that, please let me know.
I've posted the tool instruction and newest postcard rules on each Wiki' event page. Make sure you translate it. In short: 4 articles get one card, 15 get another one (Special one), and the Ambassador gets another one.
We will still allow two Ambassadors if top and second contributors have more than 30 accepted articles, just like last year. Please send this information to high-quantity participant to encourage them.
Please create
this talk page template
and linked in Wikidata. Judging tool will add this template to submitted articles automatically.
The judging tool should work fine. If not, talk to me.
You may put this template on your user page if you like it.
en:Template:User WAM organizer
Optional: Judging Tool Interface may not available in your language. If you feel needed, you can
translate the interface at here
.
Invite some active contributors from your wiki to participate. And please encourage editors who can speak more than one language participate to other WAM edition.
Indic Community:
CIS-A2K
will provide fund if you would like to organize an offline event of Wikipedia Asian Month.

Hi WAM Organizer! Hopefully everything works just fine so far!

Here are some recent updates for you, and as always, let me know if you have any idea, thought or question.
Additional souvenirs (e.g. Stickers, bookmarks) will sent to Ambassadors and active organizers.
I'm doing some basic statistics at
Result page
every week, in case you are interested.
I've already sent noticfication to global top 20 users that WMF will give global top 3 contributors a free Wikimedia T-shirt. Here are the rules:
A participant's article count is combined on all language Wikipedias they have contributed to
Only Wikipedia Asian Month on Wikipedia projects will count (no WikiQuote, etc.)
The global top 3 article count will only be eligible on Wikipedias where the WAM article requirement is at least 3,000 Bytes and 300 words.
Please make sure enforce the rules, such as proper references, notability, and length.
International organizers will double check the top 3 users' accepted articles, so if your articles are not fulfilling the rules, you might be disqualified. We don't want it happened so please don't let us make such a decision.
Rest of Global top 10 users will also get some WAM souvenirs.
Best Wishes,
Addis Wang

Please inform local participants for such problem, and tell them they can submit their contribution after the maintenance. I will send another update when the tool comes back. If you have further questions regarding the tool, please feel free to reach

Hi WAM organizers! It's now half way! Good job! Here are some updates:
As many of you may notice, that the judging tool has came back to normal.
I've set up a result page with some numbers in it. It may not accurate, just as a reference at this time.
WAM should get more media coverage. If you can help (either locally or internationally), please let me know!
Please considering start judging articles if you have not yet. it's really important to give feedbacks to participants so they can improve articles or get motivated.
With your help, I may start the first round of address collection before WAM ends for who already have four accepted articles and organizers, as I promised to improve the postcard sending process this year.
Feel free to reach out to me for any question! At
my meta talk page

Some Questions
It could be a case that local organizer does not agree on an article if shall accept it or not. In this situation, the judging tool will highlight the conflict articles in the "article's list". Please review other's opinion, and resolve the conflict by changing your decision or discuss with other judges.

Hi WAM Organizer! Hopefully, everything works just fine so far!
Need Help Button
, post in any language is fine
Here are some recent updates and clarification of rules for you, and as always, let me know if you have any idea, thought or question.
Additional souvenirs (e.g. postcard) will be sent to Ambassadors and active organizers.
A participant's article count is combined on all language Wikipedias they have contributed to
Only Wikipedia Asian Month on Wikipedia or Wikivoyage projects count (no WikiQuote, etc.)
The global top 3 article count will only be eligible on Wikipedias where the WAM article requirement is at least 3,000 bytes and 300 words.
If your community accepts an extension for articles, you should set up a page and allow participants to submit their contributions there.
In case of redirection not allowed submitting in Fountain tool, a workaround is to delete it, copy and submit again. Or a submission page can be used too.
Please make sure enforce the rules, such as proper references, notability, and length.
International organizers will double check the top 3 users' accepted articles, so if your articles are not fulfilling the rules, they might be disqualified. We don't want it happened so please don't let us make such a decision.
Please feel free to contact me and WAM team on
meta talk page
, send me an email by Email this User or chat with me on facebook. For some languages, the activity for WAM is very less, If you need any help please reach out to us, still, 12 more days left for WAM, Please encourage your community members to take part in it.

Hello. A
policy
regarding the removal of "advanced rights" (administrator, bureaucrat, interface administrator, etc.) was adopted by
community consensus
in 2013. According to this policy, the stewards are reviewing activity on wikis with no inactivity policy.
You meet the inactivity criteria (no edits and no logged actions for 2 years) on this wiki. Since this wiki, to the best of our knowledge, does not have its own rights review process, the global one applies.
If you want to keep your advanced permissions, you should inform the community of the wiki about the fact that the stewards have sent you this information about your inactivity. A community notice about this process has been also posted on the local Village Pump of this wiki. If the community has a discussion about it and then wants you to keep your rights, please contact the stewards at the
m:Stewards' noticeboard
, and link to the discussion of the local community, where they express their wish to continue to maintain the rights.
If you wish to resign your rights, please
request removal of your rights on Meta
.
If there is no response at all after one month, stewards will proceed to remove your administrator and/or bureaucrat rights. In ambiguous cases, stewards will evaluate the responses and will refer a decision back to the local community for their comment and review. If you have any questions, please contact the
stewards
.
Yours faithfully.

मुझे मैथिली भाषा नहीं आती। कृपया निम्नलिखित का अनुवाद कर दीजिए
असंख्य मुर्दा लनवरत अनगिनत फेर अलका नूपुर । कत्थक नृत्य । तखन महाकाली आ हुनक सखसहेनी सभ नरमुंडक माला गंथने - खप्परमे खून चुअबैत ।
