Hi, Sorry wring in English, I checked this Wikipedia and found that there are several articles to delete (please see here
), many were created by you so I would like to know if you agree to eliminate some of them.  Greeting

Biplab Anand
: Thank you for asking. As I checked, I found
ठुमकूर
on the list which corresponds to
en:Tumkur
. Please provide me with the specific articles I've created and which are tagged for deletion as I was not informed about this. Also, much of the articles were created when this Wiki was in the incubator and I and Biplab were two highest contributors to the project. --

Hi ..., yes, I noted that they was created a couple years ago but now they are for delete, please see:
उडुपी
en:Udupi
उत्तरा कन्नड
en:Uttara Kannada
एचएसआर लेआउट, बेंगलोर
en:HSR Layout
एमकेबी नगर
en:Mahakavi Bharathi Nagar
and others in this category
.
You think the note for deletion is wrong? Thanks.

Thanks for this more specific post. I've listed the corresponding Enwiki articles above and also updated the links on Wikidata for your perusal. --
