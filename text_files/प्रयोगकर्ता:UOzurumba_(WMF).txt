"In the broadest context, the goal is to seek enlightenment â€“ however you define it" -Steve Jobs












I am a Wikimedian, a Co-founder of the 
Igbo Wikimedians User Group
 with more than eight years of experience in Community and Social Service work. I studied Architecture and practised for some years before venturing into Community and Social Service.

My on-wiki volunteer contribution is usually in Igbo language Wikipedia and Wiktionary, Wiki Commons and Meta. Also, I am always willing to participate in initiatives to close the gender gap.













I support the 
Language and Product Localization
 team, by engaging targeted communities to provide the product team with community perspectives and feedbacks on different tools and products.
