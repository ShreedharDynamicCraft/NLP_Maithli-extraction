About me




I am a Wikimedian, a Co-founder of the 
Igbo Wikimedians User Group
 with more than eight years of experience in Community and Social Service work. I studied Architecture and practised for some years before venturing into Community and Social Service.

My on-wiki volunteer contribution is usually in Igbo language Wikipedia and Wiktionary, Wiki Commons and Meta. Also, I am always willing to participate in initiatives to close the gender gap.









My work




I support the 
Language and Product Localization
 team, by engaging targeted communities to provide the product team with community perspectives and feedbacks on different tools and products.

However, the Foundation does not vet all my activity, so edits, statements, or other contributions made by this account may not reflect the views of the Foundation.
