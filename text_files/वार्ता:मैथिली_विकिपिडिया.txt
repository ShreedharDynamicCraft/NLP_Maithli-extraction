See, I am not a Maithili and also can't understand totally but For my love for different scripts I can read a lots of scripts like Mithilakshar. So please make a good discussion on the Maithili Wikipedia logo, It is written "Wikipedia ek hukt vishvakosh" ..... Mukt is not that type, it is like "ম্ব" , not exactly but almost .
Last of all sorry to converse in English here.
Thank you,
