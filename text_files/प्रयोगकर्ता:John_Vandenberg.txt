Hi, I was a candidate for the
Board of Trustees
.  I have written some thoughts about this at:
"
m:User:John Vandenberg/WMF BoT candidature notes
"
I am married to
Siska Doviana
.
I am a sysop on the
Multilingual Wikisource
,
English Wikisource
,
Commons
and the
English Wikipedia
, have a few contributions on
enwikinews
,
enquote
and
enwikt
, and minor contributions on many other -pedia and -source sub-domains.
My favourite Wikipedia article creation is
ar:شركة نفط البحرين
:- Despite creating it in 2009, I have no idea what it says as I can't read Arabic.(However I did use Google Translate and also googled the Arabic phrases to check for copyright violations)  The fact that the Arabic article is longer than the English article about the same topic makes me smile every time.  That it was expanded by
Hccpr
, who has only six edits, is a shining example of how the values of Wikimedia allow such strange collaborations to be used for good.  However, we need to be vigilant to ensure they are not abused.
I was elected to the
English Wikipedia Arbitration Committee
by the community twice, serving in 2009 and 2011.
