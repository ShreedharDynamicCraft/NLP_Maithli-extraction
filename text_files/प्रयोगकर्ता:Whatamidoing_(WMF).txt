Community Relations, Wikimedia Foundation












In my real wiki-life, I am 
User:WhatamIdoing
.  I've been a regular editor at the English Wikipedia since 2007, and I was in the top 500 most prolific editors of all time for a couple of years.  My interests run from medicine to pastry to education, with odd points in between.  I also spend a lot of time working as a 
metapedian
, which in my case means supporting WikiProjects through the English Wikipedia's 
WikiProject Council
 and helping write policies and guidelines.
Official mistakes are made in my staff account.  Unofficial mistakes are still made in my personal account.  To find me in my volunteer capacity, look for me at 
WikiProject Medicine
 on the English Wikipedia.












From June 2013 to September 2023, I was a half-time staff member in the Wikimedia Foundation's 
Community Relations
 team.  I supported the Editing team's work on 
VisualEditor
 since shortly before its launch in 2013, and 
their work on talk pages
 since the 
mw:Talk pages consultation 2019
.
I want to know more about your community.  Please tell me what's special about your project on my talk page, or update 
m:Tell us about your Wikipedia
 and share a link with me.
