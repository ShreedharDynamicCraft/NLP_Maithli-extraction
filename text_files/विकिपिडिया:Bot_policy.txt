कृपया अपनी भाषा में अनुवादित करने में सहायता करें
Hello again. Please excuse the English.  कृपया अपनी भाषा में अनुवादित करने में सहायता करें.  धन्यवाद!
As per previous announcements earlier this year,
the visual editor
(यथादृश्य संपादिका) will be enabled at this Wikipedia in some days. It allows people to edit articles as if they were using a typical word processor. Here's a quick explanation of what is going to happen
: you can find a more detailed one, with pictures, at
mediawiki.org
.
What's changing?
In the new system, you get a
single edit tab which follows your preferences
, and that therefore will launch the wikitext editor
or
the visual editor depending on which one you opened the last (
आखिरी बार मेरे इस्तेमाल किए गए एडिटर को याद रखें
).
This applies to everyone who edited recently, including anonymous users.
How do I switch to the
other
editor then?
Buttons on the toolbars of both editors were added months ago so that you can switch from one to the other every time you want to, without losing your changes and without having to save first.
The button, located on the right side of the toolbar, looks like square brackets (
[[ ]]
) in the visual editor, and like a pencil (
) in the wikitext editor.
Are there other options available?
Yes. You can choose whether you want:
मुझे यथासंभव हमेशा यथादृश्य संपादिका दिखाएँ
(if you temporarily switch to the wikitext editor through the button on the toolbar, the system won't remember it; also, it only applies to namespaces where the visual editor is available).
मुझे हमेशा स्रोत एडिटर दिखाएँ
(if you temporarily switch to the visual editor through the button on the toolbar, the system won't remember it)
मुझे दोनों संपादक टैब दिखाएँ
(a system in place at multiple wikis since 2013. You are familiar with this option if you have been using the visual editor here.)
Please note: all the users will always have the opportunity to switch to the other editor via buttons on the toolbars, for occasional edits
.
How do I set my preference?
If you want to try or to stay in the new system: you don't need to do anything.
If you had explicitly disabled the visual editor in the past and want to keep it disabled: you don't need to do anything.
All the registered users have a dropdown menu in the
Editing tab of their Preferences
(सम्पादन कऽ रहल छी --> सम्पादन मोड:), where they can choose from.
This only needs to be done once
. Don't forget to save ;)
Users with the visual editor disabled need to re-enable it if they're interested in accessing that menu!
People who use the visual editor regularly will see a pop-up
(only once after the single edit tab system is introduced)
, and they can choose their favorite setting there. Of course, they can change their mind at any time just like the others, and pick a different setting from their Preferences.
Anonymous users who have used the visual editor recently will also be able to choose which editor they want to edit with.
Reminder: all the users will always have the opportunity to switch to the other editor via buttons on the toolbars, for occasional edits
.
Final remarks
Please spread the word about this major change
in any way that you deem appropriate for this community, by linking to this announcement elsewhere, putting up a site notice, etc. Please note it will affect all the registered users at first, and after some days it will reach logged-out contributors as well if no major technical issues have arisen.

,
Bijay chaurasia
: given your experience with this language and this community, I appreciate your support in making sure everyone here is aware of this change (and apologies for duplicate pings). Don't hesitate to ask questions, I'll be around for a while to help!
Please do let us know about any anomalies you think you're experiencing, and do post any other feedback below. I'd like to thank everyone who works to make the transition easier for this community, and whoever will help me processing feedback in your language.
You can learn more about optimizing the visual editor experience here by

Hello again. This message is only available in English at this time: कृपया अपनी भाषा में अनुवादित करने में सहायता करें.  धन्यवाद!
As some of you have noticed,
this Wikipedia now has
the visual editor
(यथादृश्य संपादिका) enabled for all registered users
. The rollout to logged-out users will likely happen in a week or so.
For an
explanation of how the editing system now works and how to choose/go back to your favorite setting, please see my previous announcement above
.
If you wish to
change your editing system preferences now, this can be done from
this link to your Preferences
--> सम्पादन कऽ रहल छी --> सम्पादन मोड:
.
All edits using the visual editor will be tagged with "भिजुअल सम्पादक" in recent changes, watchlists, and page histories.  To access the
User Guide for the visual editor
, click on the "(?)" icon in its toolbar.
Please let us know if you find any problems.  You can report issues directly in
Phabricator, the new bug tracking system
or on at
mw:VisualEditor/Feedback
; by all means, feel free to also
ping or contact me directly
if you prefer.
In case of emergency (like an unexpected bug causing widespread problems), please contact James Forrester, the product manager, at jforrester@wikimedia.org or on
IRC
in the #mediawiki-visualeditor channel.
Happy editing!
Respectfully,
Elitre (WMF)

Just a heads-up that rollout of the visual editor on this wiki is now complete. Please refer to my previous messages for details. You can
read the "checklist"
that was written to help communities like yours in their process of adapting the visual editor to their customs and needs. Best,

Hello. To facilitate
steward
granting of bot access, I suggest implementing the
standard bot policy
on this wiki. In particular, this policy allows stewards to automatically flag known interlanguage linking bots (if this page says that is acceptable), which form the vast majority of such requests. The policy also enables
global bots
on this wiki (if this page says that is acceptable), which are trusted bots that will be given bot access on every wiki that allows global bots.
This policy makes bot access requesting much easier for local users, operators, and stewards. To implement it we only need to create a redirect to this page from
Project:Bot policy
, and add a line at the top noting that it is used here. Please read the text at
m:Bot policy
before commenting. If you object, please say so; I hope to implement in two weeks if there is no objection, since it is particularly written to streamline bot requests on wikis with little or no community interested in bot access requests.

Dear friends,
In an unfortunate turn of events, Wikipedia is currently blocked in Turkey, as can be seen from
en: 2017 block of Wikipedia in Turkey
In order to express solidarity with the Turkish Wikipedia editors and readers, it is proposed that Indian Wikipedians write articles related to Turkey in their respective languages. Our message is clear — we are not motivated by any politics; we just want the Wikipedia to be unblocked in Turkey.
Participating members can create new articles on Turkish language, culture, political structure, religion, sports, etc. But the essential condition is that the articles should be related to Turkey.
Note: The normal Wikipedia rules also apply to all new articles. Wikipedia admins can facilitate other member contributions by creating project pages where users can list their newly written articles. --

Hello there,
We are inviting you to participate in
Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos 2021
, a global contest scheduled to run from July through August 2021.
Participants will choose among Wikipedia pages without photo images, then add a suitable file from among the many thousands of photos in the Wikimedia Commons, especially those uploaded from thematic contests (Wiki Loves Africa, Wiki Loves Earth, Wiki Loves Folklore, etc.) over the years.
In its first year (2020), 36 Wikimedia communities in 27 countries joined the campaign. Events relating to the campaign included training organized by at least 18 Wikimedia communities in 14 countries.
The campaign resulted in the addition of media files (photos, audios and videos) to more than 90,000 Wikipedia articles in 272 languages.
Wikipedia Pages Wanting Photos (WPWP) offers an ideal task for recruiting and guiding new editors through the steps of adding content to existing pages. Besides individual participation, the WPWP campaign can be used by user groups and chapters to organize editing workshops and edit-a-thons.
The organizing team is looking for a contact person to coordinate WPWP participation at the Wikimedia user group or chapter level (geographically or thematically) or for a language WP. We’d be glad for you to reply to this message, or sign up directly at
WPWP Participating Communities
.
Please feel free to contact
Organizing Team
if you have any query.
Kind regards,
Tulsi Bhagat

नमस्ते Friends!
Apologies as this message is not in your native language, कृपया अपनी भाषा में अनुवादित करने में सहायता करें.
The WMF Language team is pleased to let you know that we will like to enable the Section and Content translation tool in Maithili Wikipedia. For this, our team will love you to read about the tool and test the new
Section Translation tool
so you can:
Give us your feedback
Ask us questions
Tell us how to improve it
Below is background information about the tools and how you can test the Section translation tool.
Background information
Content Translation
has been a successful tool for editors to create content in their language. More than one million articles have been created across all languages since the tool was released in 2015. However, the tool is not out of beta in Maithili Wikipedia, limiting the discoverability of the tool and its use and blocking the enablement of the Section translation in your Wikipedia
Section Translation
extends the capabilities of Content Translation to support mobile devices. On mobile, the tool will:
Guide you to translate one section at a time in order to expand existing articles or create new ones
Make it easy to transfer knowledge across languages anytime from your mobile device
We plan to enable the tools on Maithili Wikipedia in the coming week if there are no objections from your community. After it is enabled, we’ll monitor the content created with the tools and process all the feedback. In any case, feel free to raise any concerns or questions you may already have as a reply to this message or on
the project talk page
Try the Section translation tool
Before the enablement, you can try the current implementation of the tool in
our testing instance
. Once it is enabled on Maithili Wikipedia, you’ll have access to
https://mai.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ContentTranslation
with your mobile device. You can select an article to translate, and machine translation will be provided as a starting point for editors to improve.
Provide feedback
Please provide feedback about Section translation on
the project talk page
. We want to  hear about your impressions on
The section translation tool
What do you think about our plans to enable it
Your ideas for improving the tool
Thanks and we look forward to your feedback and questions.

नमस्ते Friends!
The WMF Language team is pleased to let you know that we
have enabled the Section translation
and
Content translation
tools in Maithili Wikipedia.
The
Content translation tool
can be discovered by users
through several entry points
. However, users not interested in translation can disable it
from their preferences
. Also, with the
Section translation tool
, you can start translating an article on your mobile device right when you notice it is missing in Maithili. From a Wikipedia article in any language, switch languages and search for मैथिली. If the article does not exist, an option to translate it will appear, as shown in the image below.
We know that these tools will help translators in your community to add content using any device with ease. Content created with the Content and Section Translation tool will be marked with the "
contenttranslation
" and “
sectiontranslaiton
” tag, respectively, for the community to review. We’ll monitor the content created, but we are interested in hearing about your experience using the tools and reviewing the content created with it.
So, enjoy the tools and
provide feedback
on improving it.
Thank you!

नमस्ते Maithili Wikipedians!
Apologies as this message is not in your native language, कृपया अपनी भाषा में अनुवादित करने में सहायता करें.
The
WMF Language team
wants to make
MinT
the default machine translation support in Maithili Wikipedia
Content Translation
. MinT uses the
IndicTrans2
machine translation model, which recently has a new version.
Our proposal to set MinT as the default machine translation service in this Wikipedia will expose contributors to open source service by default and allow them to switch to other services if they prefer those services. Contributors can decide to switch to another translation service that is not default if they prefer the service, which will be helpful in analysing user preferences in the future.
The WMF Language team is requesting feedback from members of this community in this thread if making the MinT the default translation service is okay in Maithili Wikipedia. If there are no objections to the above proposal. In that case, MinT will become the default machine translation in this Wikipedia by the end of January 2024.
Thank you for your feedback.

Hi all,
The next language community meeting is scheduled in a few weeks—on August 30th at 15:00 UTC. If you're interested in joining, you can
sign up on this wiki page
.
This participant-driven meeting will focus on sharing language-specific updates related to various projects, discussing technical issues related to language wikis, and working together to find possible solutions. For example, in the last meeting, topics included the Language Converter, the state of language research, updates on the Incubator conversations, and technical challenges around external links not working with special characters on Bengali sites.
Do you have any ideas for topics to share technical updates or discuss challenges? Please add agenda items to the document
here
and reach out to ssethi(__AT__)wikimedia.org. We look forward to your participation!

Hello everyone, I previously wrote on the 27th September to advise that the
Wikidata item
sitelink will change places in the sidebar menu, moving from the
General
section into the
In Other Projects
section. The scheduled rollout date of 04.10.2024 was delayed due to a necessary request for Mobile/MinervaNeue skin. I am happy to inform that the global rollout can now proceed and will occur later today, 22.10.2024 at 15:00 UTC-2.
Please let us know
if you notice any problems or bugs after this change. There should be no need for null-edits or purging cache for the changes to occur. Kind regards, -
