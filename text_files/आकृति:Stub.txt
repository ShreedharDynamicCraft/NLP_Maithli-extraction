This template is used to identify a stub. It uses {{
asbox
}}, which is a meta-template designed to ease the process of creating and maintaining stub templates.





Typing 
{{Stub}}
 produces the message shown at the beginning, and adds the article to the following category:



श्रेणी:अपूर्ण लेख
 (कुल गिनती: 2933)




This is a 
stub template
. A brief explanation of these templates follows; for full details please consult 
Wikipedia:Stub
.

A stub is an article containing only a few sentences of text which is too short to provide encyclopedic coverage of a subject.

If possible, try to find the most appropriate stub template for the article. A full list can be found at 
Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/List of stubs
.


Two or more different stub templates may be used, if necessary, though no more than four should be used on any article.


Place a stub template 
at the very end
 of the article, after the "External links" section, any navigation templates, and the category tags. As usual, templates are added by including their name inside double braces, e.g. 
{{stub}}
.

Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting


New stub templates and categories (collectively "stub types") should not be created without prior proposal at 
Wikipedia:WikiProject Stub sorting/Proposals
. This allows for the proper coordination of all stub types across Wikipedia, and for the checking of any new stub type for possible problems prior to its creation.
