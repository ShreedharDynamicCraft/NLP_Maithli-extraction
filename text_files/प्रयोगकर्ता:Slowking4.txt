The harm is that telling people to “assume good intent” is a sign that if they come to you with a concern, you will minimize their feelings, police their reactions, and question their perceptions. It tells marginalized people that you don’t see codes of conduct as tools to address systemic discrimination, but as tools to manage personal conflicts without taking power differences into account. Telling people to “assume good intent” sends a message about whose feelings you plan to center when an issue arises in your community.
I know that it is not going to happen .. Jimmy Wales sending me 1 million dollar is not going to happen either.  I will just have to live with it.  And if I have the choice between checking with Google to see whether WikiData is correct, and if it is not using Google to get the correct data, or skip WikiData and just get the correct data from Google directly, then I choose the latter option.  WikiData has its place in this world, but no place on en.wikipedia.
this is hilarious. you realize that
knowledge graph
uses wikidata, google having abandoned their knowledge database in favor of it?
have you tried a grant request? what would you spend it on, other than "send me money"? wikidata on the other hand, has no funding problems.

***
love the spirit outside of yourself: for the collective unconscious is greater than you
make no little plans: for failure in the right is better than success in the wrong
be charitable in good fortune: for the world created it
be steadfast in adversity: for Sisyphus was happy
be not afraid: for the end of things is better than the beginning
be not angry: for a quarrel will empty your fortune by the law
be not envious: for Schwesternschaft is better than Schadenfreude
speak the truth: for yours are unclean lips in a land of unclean lips
honor your grandparents and grandchildren: for we owe a debt to the past and future, not the present
rest and reflect every seventh day, and seventh year: for life is not from task to task, but dream to dream (after  Szilárd
