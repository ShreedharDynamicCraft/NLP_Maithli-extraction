केओक लोग बीचरला विकीपीडिया ख़बर आर बीचरला विकीपीडिया AdvancedSiteNotices मे Telegram, Instagram, Google Form जकरा ब्रांड नाम पूरा उल्लेख न करलि आर एकरा बाहरी लिंक न बना कऽ कहनि, आर ई सभ बात
Phabricator T375253 पर तुरंत ठीक करी जाए
। ई मोटाई मे अवास्तविक आर बहुत आघाती लागत अछि, आर हम आशा करत छी कि आप सभ के और अधिक राय सुनी। कारण आप के विकी मे भी एही समस्या अछि आर ई समस्या बहुत जल्दी सुलझाइल जाएत, तेँ हम सुझाव देत छी कि आप लोग के समुदाय समझौता होई आर फेर Phabricator T375253 के एकर राय दिही। ओ कहलक: "मुझे पूरा यकीन हैं कि आप सितेनोटिस मे Telegram या Instagram या Google के ब्रांड नाम का जिक्र नहीं कर सकते या उनकी लिंक नहीं दे सकते। CentralNotice से तो नहीं दे सकते, तो यहां पर अलग नीति क्यों लागु होनी चाहिए। आप अपने विकी पर उनका पृष्ठ बना सकते हैं और सितेनोटिस से उस पृष्ठ पर लिंक दे सकते हैं, लेकिन सितेनोटिस से सीधे बाहरी साइट पर लिंक नहीं दे सकते। ई बहुत जरूरी है, तुरंत ठीक करके देखो। (जब तक कि आप हमें नहीं दिखा देते कि कोई ऐसा कहा है कि ये ठीक है)"
AdvancedSiteNotices is prohibited from linking to external brands?
Someone believes that the Chinese Wikipedia News and Chinese Wikipedia AdvancedSiteNotices should not fully mention brand names such as Telegram, Instagram, Google Form, or use external links to these, and this needs to be
fixed on Phabricator T375253
immediately. I find this to be completely unreasonable and deeply regrettable, and I hope to seek more opinions from you all. Since your wiki also has the same situation and this problem should be fixed very soon in the future, I suggest that you reach a community consensus and then submit an opinion to Phabricator T375253. They said: "I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to link to or even mention the brand names Telegram or Instagram or Google from a sitenotice. you can't from a CentralNotice, I don't see why a different policy should apply here. you can link to those pages from a page on your wiki and link from the sitenotice to that page on your wiki. but not directly from sitenotice to the external site. this is urgent, must be fixed immediately. (unless you can show us where someone said this is ok?)"--

Dear Wikimedians,
We are excited to announce the launch of the
Indic writing systems campaign 2025
, which will take place from 23 January 2025 (World Endangered Writing Day) to 21 February 2025 (International Mother Language Day). This initiative is part of the ongoing efforts of
WikiProject writing Systems
to raise awareness about the documentation and revitalization of writing systems, many of which are currently underrepresented or endangered.
Representatives from important organizations that work with writing systems, such as Endangered Alphabets and the Script Encoding Initiative, support the campaign. The campaign will feature two primary activities focused on the
list of target scripts
:
Wikidata Labelathon
: A focused effort to improve and expand the information related to South Asian scripts on Wikidata.
Wikipedia Translatathon
: A collaborative activity aimed at enhancing the coverage of South Asian writing systems and their cultural significance on Wikipedia.
We are looking for local organizers to engage their respective communities. If you are interested in organizing, kindly sign-up
here
. We also encourage all Indic Wikimedians to
join us
in this important campaign to help document and celebrate the diverse writing systems of South Asia.
Thank you for your support, and we look forward to your active participation.
Regards
