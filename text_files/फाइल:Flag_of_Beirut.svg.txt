 appears to have been 
inadequately
 vectorized, for example, by 
auto-tracing
, and may require 
revectorization
 to meet quality standards.
Automatic tracing of complex images can produce overly-large files, inaccurate outlines, and often miss out smaller details completely. Please consider editing this image by hand in a 
vector editor
 to improve it. For further information please see our
