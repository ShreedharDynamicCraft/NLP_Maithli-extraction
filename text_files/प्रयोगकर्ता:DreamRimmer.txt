I created my account in April 2021, but I really got into editing in March 2023. Editing articles about Indian films and politics is something I truly enjoy, and I am equally fascinated by German history and politics. Turkish cinema is another area of interest for me. I write bots, regularly combat vandalism. I am mainly a tech person. I have created many 
user scripts
 and tools and contributed code on Gerrit and GitHub.

I currently run three bots: 
DreamRimmer bot III
