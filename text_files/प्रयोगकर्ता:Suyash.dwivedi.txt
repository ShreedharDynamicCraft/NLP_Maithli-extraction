My work




I am contributing to Wikipedia and its sister projects for more than 
12
 years. After attending 
WikiConference India 2016
, and 
TTT2017
, I felt there is a lot of work to do in the field of awareness of Wikipedia among societies and outreach activities so, other than online editing I am more involved in 
organising
 conferences, meetups, GLAM, online photography competitions like 
Wiki Love Monuments
,
Wikipedia Asian Month
, 
IIAB
 Hardware development and doing Hardware Hacks and Hackathon etc.

 I contribute to the Wikimedia projects, and this is the account I try to use for edits or statements I make in a volunteer role.

I also provide paid translation support for the Wikimedia Foundation's organization communications translators group.
