Did you know?




Did you know that you can review your changes visually? 



When you are finished editing the page, type your edit summary and then choose "अपने बदलाव की समीक्षा करें".  

In visual mode, you will see additions, removals, new links, and formatting highlighted.  Other changes, such as changing the size of an image, are described in notes on the side.








Click the toggle button to switch between visual and wikitext diffs.








The wikitext diff is the same diff tool that is used in the wikitext editors and in the page history. You can read and help translate 
the user guide
, which has more information about how to use the visual editor.






Since the last newsletter, the 
VisualEditor Team
 has spent most of their time supporting 
the 2017 wikitext editor mode
 which is available inside the visual editor as a Beta Feature, and adding 
the new visual diff tool
. Their workboard is available 
in Phabricator
.  You can find links to the work finished each week at  
mw:VisualEditor/Weekly triage meetings
.   Their 
current priorities
 are fixing bugs, supporting the 2017 wikitext editor as a 
beta feature
, and improving the visual diff tool.   



Recent changes
[
सम्पादन करी
]


A 
new wikitext editing mode
 is available as a Beta Feature on desktop devices.  The 
2017 wikitext editor
 has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  Go to 
Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures
 to enable the ⧼Visualeditor-preference-newwikitexteditor-label⧽.


A new 
visual diff tool
 is available in VisualEditor's visual mode.  You can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  More features will be added to this later.  In the future, this tool may be integrated into other MediaWiki components. 
[१]


The team have added 
multi-column support for lists of footnotes
. The 
<references />
 block can automatically display long lists of references in columns on wide screens.  This makes footnotes easier to read.  You can 
request multi-column support
 for your wiki. 
[२]


You can now use your web browser's function to switch typing direction in the new wikitext mode. This is particularly helpful for RTL language users like Urdu or Hebrew who have to write JavaScript or CSS. You can use Command+Shift+X or Control+Shift+X to trigger this. 
[३]


The way to switch between the visual editing mode and the wikitext editing mode is now consistent. There is a drop-down menu that shows the two options. This is now the same in desktop and mobile web editing, and inside things that embed editing, such as Flow. 
[४]


The श्रेणियाँ item has been moved to the top of the पृष्ठ विकल्प menu (from clicking on the "hamburger" icon) for quicker access. 
[५]
 There is also now a "Templates used on this page" feature there. 
[६]


You can now create 
<chem>
  tags (sometimes used as 
<ce>
) for chemical formulas inside the visual editor. 
[७]


Tables can be set as collapsed or un-collapsed. 
[८]


The विशेष संकेत menu now includes characters for Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics and angle quotation marks (‹› and ⟨⟩) .  The team thanks the volunteer developer, 
Tpt
. 
[९]


A bug caused some section edit conflicts to blank the rest of the page.  This has been fixed.  The team are sorry for the disruption. 
[१०]


There is a new keyboard shortcut for citations:  
Control
+
Shift
+
K
 on a PC, or 
Command
+
Shift
+
K
 on a Mac.  It is based on the keyboard shortcut for making links, which is 
Control
+
K
 or 
Command
+
K
 respectively. 
[११]


Future changes
[
सम्पादन करी
]


The team is working on a syntax highlighting tool.  It will highlight matching pairs of 
<ref>
 tags and other types of wikitext syntax.  You will be able to turn it on and off.  It will first become available in VisualEditor's built-in wikitext mode, maybe late in 2017. 
[१२]


The kind of button used to पूर्वप्रदर्शन, परिवर्तन देखाबी, and finish an edit will change in all WMF-supported wikitext editors.  The new buttons will use 
OOjs UI
.  The buttons will be larger, brighter, and easier to read.  The labels will remain the same.  You can test the new button by editing a page and adding 
&ooui=1
 to the end of the URL, like this:  
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Project:Sandbox?action=edit&ooui=1
  The old appearance will no longer be possible, even with local CSS changes.  
[१३]


The 
outdated 2006 wikitext editor
 will be removed later this year.  It is used by approximately 0.03% of active editors.  See 
a list of editing tools on mediawiki.org
 if you are uncertain which one you use.

Did you know?


Did you know that you can now use the 
visual diff tool
 on any page?





Sometimes, it is hard to see important changes in a wikitext diff.  This screenshot of a wikitext diff (click to enlarge) shows that the paragraphs have been rearranged, but it does not highlight the removal of a word or the addition of a new sentence.

If you 
enable the Beta Feature
 for "⧼visualeditor-preference-visualdiffpage-label⧽", you will have a new option.  It will give you a new box at the top of every diff page.  This box will let you choose either diff system on any edit.





Click the toggle button to switch between visual and wikitext diffs.

In the visual diff, additions, removals, new links, and formatting changes will be highlighted.  Other changes, such as changing the size of an image, are described in notes on the side.





This screenshot shows the same edit as the wikitext diff.  The visual diff highlights the removal of one word and the addition of a new sentence.

The 
2017 wikitext editor
 is 
available as a Beta Feature
 on desktop devices.  It has the same toolbar as the visual editor and can use the citoid service and other modern tools.  The team have been comparing the performance of different editing environments.  They have studied how long it takes to open the page and start typing.  The study uses data for more than one million edits during December and January.  Some changes have been made to improve the speed of the 2017 wikitext editor and the visual editor.  Recently, the 2017 wikitext editor opened fastest for most edits, and the 2010 WikiEditor was fastest for some edits.  More information will be posted at 
mw:Contributors/Projects/Editing performance
.


The 
visual diff tool
 was developed for the visual editor.  It is now available to all users of the visual editor and the 2017 wikitext editor.  When you review your changes, you can toggle between wikitext and visual diffs.  You can also 
enable the new Beta Feature
 for "Visual diffs".  The Beta Feature lets you use the visual diff tool to view other people's edits on page histories and

Wikitext syntax highlighting
 is available as a Beta Feature for both 
the 2017 wikitext editor

The 
citoid service
 automatically translates URLs, DOIs, ISBNs, and PubMed id numbers into wikitext citation templates.  It is very popular and useful to editors, although it can be a bit tricky to set up.  
Your wiki can have this service.  Please 
read the instructions
. You can 
ask the team to help you enable citoid at your wiki

Welcome back to the 
Editing
 newsletter.

Since 
the last newsletter
, the team has released two new features for the 
mobile visual editor
 and has started developing three more.  All of this work is part of the team's goal to 
make editing on mobile web simpler
.  

Before talking about the team's recent releases, we have a question for you:  

Are you willing to try a new way to add and change links?


If you are interested, we would value your input!  You can try this new link tool in the mobile visual editor on a separate wiki. 

Follow these instructions and share your experience:


📲 Try Edit Cards
.




Recent releases
[
सम्पादन करी
]


The mobile visual editor is a simpler editing tool, for smartphones and tablets using the 
mobile site
.  The Editing team recently launched two new features to improve the mobile visual editor: 



Section editing


The purpose is to help contributors focus on their edits.


The team studied this with an A/B test.  
This test showed
 that contributors who could use section editing were 
1% more likely to publish
 the edits they started than people with only full-page editing.


Loading overlay


The purpose is to smooth the transition between reading and editing.


Section editing and the new loading overlay are 
now available to everyone
 using the mobile visual editor.



New and active projects

This is a list of our most active projects. 
Watch
 these pages to learn about project updates and to share your input on new designs, prototypes and research findings.



Edit cards
: This is a clearer way to add and edit links, citations, images, templates, etc. in articles.  You can try this feature now.  
Go here to see how:
 
📲 
Try Edit Cards
.


Mobile toolbar refresh
: This project will learn if contributors are more successful when the editing tools are easier to recognize.


Mobile visual editor availability
: This A/B test asks:  
Are newer contributors more successful if they use the mobile visual editor?
  We are collaborating with 
20 Wikipedias
 to answer this question.


Usability improvements
: This project will make the mobile visual editor easier to use.  The goal is to let contributors stay focused on editing and to feel more confident in the editing tools.


Looking ahead

Wikimania:
  Several members of the Editing Team will be attending 
Wikimania
 in August 2019.  They will lead a session about mobile editing in the

The 
Talk Pages Consultation
 was a global consultation to define better tools for wiki communication. From February through June 2019, more than 500 volunteers on 20 wikis, across 15 languages and multiple projects, came together with members of the Foundation to create a product direction for a set of discussion tools.  The 
Phase 2 Report
 of the Talk Page Consultation was published in August. It summarizes the product direction the team has started to work on, which you can read more about here: 
Talk Page Project project page
. 

The team needs and wants your help at this early stage.  They are starting to develop the first idea. Please add your name to the 
"Getting involved"
 section of the project page, if you would like to hear about opportunities to participate.

What happens when you click on a link.  The new Edit Card is bigger and has more options for editing links.


On 3 September, the Editing team released 
version 3 of Edit Cards
. Anyone could use the new version in the mobile visual editor.


There is an 
updated design
 on the Edit Card for adding and modifying links.  There is also a new, 
combined workflow for editing a link's display text and target
.


Feedback: You can try the new Edit Cards by opening the mobile visual editor on a smartphone. Please post your feedback on the

Toolbar
[

The editing toolbar is changing in the mobile visual editor.  The old system had two different toolbars.  Now, all the buttons are together.  
Tell the team what you think about the new toolbar
.


In September, the Editing team updated the mobile visual editor's editing toolbar.  Anyone could see these changes in the mobile visual editor.

One toolbar:
 All of the editing tools are located in one toolbar.  Previously, the toolbar changed when you clicked on different things.


New navigation:
 The buttons for moving forward and backward in the edit flow have changed.


Seamless switching:

This early version of the Reply tool automatically signs and indents comments.


The 
Editing team
 has been working on 
the talk pages project
.  The goal of the talk pages project is to help contributors communicate on wiki more easily.  This project is the result of the 
Talk pages consultation 2019
. 



In a future update, the team plans to test a tool for easily linking to another user's name, a rich-text editing option, and other tools.


The team is building a 
new tool for replying
 to comments now.  This early version can sign and indent comments automatically.  
Please 
test the new Reply tool
.




On 31 March 2020, the new उत्तर दें tool was offered as a 
Beta Feature
 editors at four Wikipedias:  
Arabic
, 
Dutch
, 
French
, and 
Hungarian
.  If your community also wants early access to the new tool, contact 
User:Whatamidoing (WMF)
.


The team is planning some upcoming changes.  
Please 
review the proposed design
 and share your thoughts on the talk page.
  The team will test features such as:

an easy way to mention another editor ("pinging"),


a rich-text visual editing option, and


other features identified through user testing or recommended by editors.


To hear more about Editing Team updates, please add your name to the 
"Get involved"
 section of the project page. You can also watch

Images on mai.wikipedia
[
सम्पादन करी
]


Hello!

I like to work on files and I noticed that mai.wiki have 105 files. Only admins can upload files.

All files must meet 
wmf:Resolution:Licensing_policy
 and that means all files must meet either:



Free files must have a valid license etc.


Non-free files must live up to the EDP (it requires that mai.wiki have one)


If the files do not meet the requirements they should be replaced by other files and be deleted.

I can't see mai listed on 
m:Non-free_content
. If you want to host non-free images you need an EDP and perhaps you should make it possible for other than admins to upload files? If you decide you do not want to host non-free files you should delete the uploaded files. --

The new features include a toolbar.  
What do you think should be in the toolbar?


This issue of the 
Editing
 newsletter includes information the 
Talk pages project
, an effort to help contributors communicate on wiki more easily.



Reply tool
: This is available as a Beta Feature at the four partner wikis (Arabic, Dutch, French, and Hungarian Wikipedias).  The Beta Feature is called "चर्चा उपकरण".  The Beta Feature will get 
new features
 soon.  The new features include writing comments in a new visual editing mode and pinging other users by typing 
@
. You can 
test the new features
 on the 
Beta Cluster
 now.  Some other wikis will have a chance to try the Beta Feature in the coming months.


New requirements for user signatures
:  Soon, users will not be able to save invalid custom signatures in 
Special:Preferences
. This will reduce signature spoofing, prevent page corruption, and make new talk page tools more reliable.  Most editors will not be affected.


New discussion tool
:  The Editing team is beginning work on a simpler process for starting new discussions.   You can 
see the initial design on the project page
.


Research on the use of talk pages
:  The Editing team worked with the 
Wikimedia research team
 to study how talk pages help editors improve articles.  We learned that new editors who use talk pages make more edits to the main namespace than new editors who don't use talk pages.

More than 
50 million edits
 have been made using the visual editor on desktop.


Seven years ago this month, the 
Editing team
 offered the visual editor to most Wikipedia editors.  Since then, editors have achieved many milestones:



More than 
50 million edits
 have been made using the visual editor on desktop.


More than 
2 million new articles
 have been created in the visual editor. More than 600,000 of these new articles were created during 2019.


The visual editor is 
increasingly popular
.  The proportion of all edits made using the visual editor has increased every year since its introduction.


In 2019, 
35% of the edits by newcomers
 (logged-in editors with ≤99 edits) used the visual editor. This percentage has 
increased every year
.


Almost 
5 million edits on the mobile site
 have been made with the visual editor.  Most of these edits have been made since the Editing team started improving the 
mobile visual editor
 in 2018.


On 17 November 2019, the 
first edit from outer space
 was made in the mobile visual editor. 🚀 👩‍🚀


Editors have made more than 
7 million edits in the 2017 wikitext editor
, including starting 
600,000 new articles
 in it.  The 
2017 wikitext editor
 is VisualEditor's built-in wikitext mode.  You can 
enable it in your preferences
.

The number of comments posted with the Reply Tool from March through June 2020. People used the Reply Tool to post over 
7,400 comments
 with the tool.


The 
Reply tool
 has been available as a 
Beta Feature
 at the Arabic, Dutch, French and Hungarian Wikipedias since 31 March 2020.  The 
first analysis showed positive results
.



More than 
300 editors
 used the Reply tool at these four Wikipedias.  They  posted more than 
7,400 replies
 during the study period.


Of the people who posted a comment with the Reply tool, about 70% of them used the tool multiple times.  About 60% of them used it on multiple days.


Comments from Wikipedia editors are positive.  One said, 
أعتقد أن الأداة تقدم فائدة ملحوظة؛ فهي تختصر الوقت لتقديم رد بدلًا من التنقل بالفأرة إلى وصلة تعديل القسم أو الصفحة، التي تكون بعيدة عن التعليق الأخير في الغالب، ويصل المساهم لصندوق التعديل بسرعة باستخدام الأداة.
  ("I think the tool has a significant impact; it saves time to reply while the classic way is to move with a mouse to the Edit link to edit the section or the page which is generally far away from the comment. And the user reaches to the edit box so quickly to use the Reply tool.")
[१९]


The Editing team released the Reply tool as a Beta Feature at eight other Wikipedias in early August.  Those Wikipedias are in the Chinese, Czech, Georgian, Serbian, Sorani Kurdish, Swedish, Catalan, and Korean languages.  If you would like to use the Reply tool at your wiki, please tell 
User talk:Whatamidoing (WMF)
.

The Reply tool is still in active development.  Per request from the Dutch Wikipedia and other editors, you will be able to 
customize the edit summary
.  (The default edit summary is "Reply".)  A "ping" feature is available in the Reply tool's visual editing mode.  This feature searches for usernames.  Per request from the Arabic Wikipedia, each wiki will be able to 
set its own preferred symbol
 for pinging editors.  Per request from editors at the Japanese and Hungarian Wikipedias, each wiki can 
define a preferred signature prefix
 in the page 
MediaWiki:Discussiontools-signature-prefix
.   For example, some languages omit spaces before signatures.  Other communities want to add a dash or a non-breaking space.



New requirements for user signatures
[
सम्पादन करी
]


The 
new requirements for custom user signatures
 began on 6 July 2020.  If you try to create a custom signature that does not meet the requirements, you will get an error message.


Existing custom signatures that do not meet the new requirements will be unaffected 
temporarily
. Eventually, all custom signatures will need to meet the new requirements.  You can 
check your signature and see lists of active editors
 whose custom signatures need to be corrected.  Volunteers have been contacting editors who need to change their custom signatures.  If you need to change your custom signature, then please 
read the help page
.

Next, the team will be working on a tool for quickly and easily starting a new discussion section to a talk page. To follow the development of this new tool, please put the

Yes, the errors are gone now. Thanks for fixing. Previously there was nineteen thousand errors. Now there is two thousand. So the welcome template was affecting seventeen thousand pages. The error reports can be seen in विशेष पन्नासभ → Lint errors → Missing end tag. I have cleaned up some of them.

Completion rates for comments made with the Reply tool and full-page wikitext editing. Details and limitations are in this 
report
.


The 
Reply tool
 is available at most Wikipedias. 



The Reply tool has been deployed as an opt-out 
preference
 to all editors at the Arabic, Czech, and Hungarian Wikipedias.


It is also available as a 
Beta Feature
 at almost all Wikipedias except for the English, Russian, and German-language Wikipedias.  If it is not available at your wiki, you can request it by following 
these simple instructions
.


Research notes:




As of January 2021, 
more than 3,500 editors
 have used the Reply tool to post about 
70,000 comments
.


We have preliminary data from the Arabic, Czech, and Hungarian Wikipedia on the Reply tool.  
Junior Contributors
 who use the Reply tool are more likely to publish the comments they start writing than those who use full-page wikitext editing.
[२०]


The Editing and Parsing teams have significantly reduced the number of edits that affect other parts of the page.  About 0.3% of edits did this during the last month.
[२१]
 Some of the remaining changes are automatic corrections for 
Special:LintErrors
.


 
A large 
A/B test
 will start soon.
[२२]
 This is part of 
the process
 to offer the Reply tool to everyone.  During this test, half of all editors at 
24 Wikipedias
 will have the Reply tool automatically enabled, and half will not. You can still turn it on or off for your own account in 
Special:Preferences
.

When newcomers had the Reply tool and tried to post on a talk page, they were more successful at posting a comment. (
Source
)


Earlier this year, the Editing team ran a large study of 
the Reply Tool
.  The main goal was to find out whether the Reply Tool helped 
newer editors
 communicate on wiki.  The second goal was to see whether the comments that newer editors made using the tool needed to be reverted more frequently than comments newer editors made with the existing wikitext page editor.

The key results were:



Newer editors who had automatic ("default on") access to the Reply tool were 
more likely
 to post a comment on a talk page.


The comments that newer editors made with the Reply Tool were also 
less likely
 to be reverted than the comments that newer editors made with page editing.


These results give the Editing team confidence that the tool is helpful.

Looking ahead


The team is planning to make the Reply tool available to everyone as an opt-out preference in the coming months.  This has already happened at the Arabic, Czech, and Hungarian Wikipedias.

The next step is to 
resolve a technical challenge
. Then, they will deploy the Reply tool first to the 
Wikipedias that participated in the study
.  After that, they will deploy it, in stages, to the other Wikipedias and all WMF-hosted wikis.

You can turn on "चर्चा उपकरण" 
in Beta Features
 now.  After you get the Reply tool, you can change your preferences at any time in 
Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-editing-discussion
.

How we will see unregistered users
[
सम्पादन करी
]




Hi!

You get this message because you are an admin on a Wikimedia wiki.

When someone edits a Wikimedia wiki without being logged in today, we show their IP address. As you may already know, we will not be able to do this in the future. This is a decision by the Wikimedia Foundation Legal department, because norms and regulations for privacy online have changed.

Instead of the IP we will show a masked identity. You as an admin 
will still be able to access the IP
. There will also be a new user right for those who need to see the full IPs of unregistered users to fight vandalism, harassment and spam without being admins. Patrollers will also see part of the IP even without this user right. We are also working on 
better tools
 to help.

If you have not seen it before, you can 
read more on Meta
. If you want to make sure you don’t miss technical changes on the Wikimedia wikis, you can 
subscribe
 to 
the weekly technical newsletter
.

We have 
two suggested ways
 this identity could work. 
We would appreciate your feedback
 on which way you think would work best for you and your wiki, now and in the future. You can 
let us know on the talk page
. You can write in your language. The suggestions were posted in October and we will decide after 17 January.

Thank you.
