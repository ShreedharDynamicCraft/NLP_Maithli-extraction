About me




I was born in 1992 in Tehran, Iran but I currently live in Berlin, Germany. I studied physics at university.









My work




I have been active since 2006 and my home wiki is Persian Wikipedia where I'm sysop, bureaucrat, oversight and check user but you can find me in other wikis too. I'm currently working as Staff Database Architect in WMF (data persistence subteam of SRE). I used to work as software engineer in Wikidata team in Wikimedia Deutschland.

In my volunteer capacity, I've been doing lots of small technical things like maintaining our mailing lists, co-maintaining 
codesearch
, building tools for CheckUsers and improving database schema design and consistency of mediawiki core, and improving the software behind mailing lists. I'm also member of 
Code of Conduct Committee
 in technical spaces.
(I try to keep track of my volunteer technical work in 
mw:User:Ladsgroup/Volunteer stuff
)

I'm also 
global interface editor
, meaning I'll be editing your wiki's interface to prevent it from breaking.
